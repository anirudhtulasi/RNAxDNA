# Reverse-and-complement-nucleic-acid-sequences-DNA-RNA-using-Python
A Python program that constructs reverse, complement, and reverse-complement nucleic acid sequences (DNA, RNA). Finally we will read a file that has a long DNA sequence and then apply the code to the data in the file. We will use the novel coronavirus genome for this.
